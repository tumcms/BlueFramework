## Deployment

If you want to deploy the BlueFramework you have to build the “DEPLOY” project. This project requieres an installation of the Nullsoft Scriptable Install System (NSIS). Currently (at the time of writing this) we are using NSIS 3.0 which can be donwloaded [here](http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Main_Page).

**Open Questions**

* Why does the INSTALL project not handle this?
* Why is the name of the project DEPLOY and not Deploy?
