			//! The DocumentManger is used to manage a Single Document Interface (SDI), it could be easily extended to support Multiply Document Interface (MDI). SDI is preferred over 
			//! MDI because its not as confusing to the user as MDI. Also is it possible to open a number of other instances of the application.
